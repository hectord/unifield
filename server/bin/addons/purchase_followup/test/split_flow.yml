  In order to test the purchase order followup in a
  split move flow, we will create a purchase order with
  one line, confirm it and see the result in the followup
  tool. Confirm partially the move and see the changes in 
  the followup tool.

    I create supplier
-
  !record {model: res.partner, id: supplier_split_flow}:
    name: S1
    supplier: True
-
    I create the address for the supplier
-
  !record {model: res.partner.address, id: address_split_flow}:
    name: S1
    partner_id: supplier_split_flow
-
  I create a product category
-
  !record {model: product.category, id: prod_cat_split_flow}:
    name: Categ1
-
    I create the product
-
  !record {model: product.product, id: product_split_flow}:
    categ_id: prod_cat_split_flow

    mes_type: fixed

  I create a new Purchase order
-
  !record {model: purchase.order, id: po_split_flow}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    date_order: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    invoice_method: order
    location_id: stock.stock_location_stock
    partner_address_id: address_split_flow
    partner_id: supplier_split_flow
    pricelist_id: purchase.list0
-
  I create a line for the Purchase order
-
  !record {model: purchase.order.line, id: pol_split_flow}:
    product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
    product_id: product_split_flow
    order_id: po_split_flow
    price_unit: 1.30
    product_qty: 10
    name: P1
    date_planned: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
- 
  I confirm the purchase order
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    import netsvc
    wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
    wf_service.trg_validate(uid, 'purchase.order', ref('po_split_flow'), 'purchase_confirm', cr)

-
  I launch the purchase followup wizard
-

    context = {'active_id':  ref('po_split_flow'),
               'active_ids': [ref('po_split_flow')]}
    res = self.run(cr, uid, [ref('action_purchase_order_follow_up')], context)
    assert res != False, "Error on ir.actions.server launching"

  I check if the wizard is related to the purchase order and if the information are ok

    self.unlink(cr, uid, wiz_ids, context=context)

  Confirm partially the move (create a back order)
