    Records the modification of the cost price (standard_price) of a product.
    It is complementary (but independent) to the Track Changes feature.

    To record the modification of the cost price, the product Costing Method
    should always be average price. The recorded prices are always in
    functional currency.

    Here is the list of transactions where a modification of the cost price
    is recorded:
      * at original import/creation of Product,
      * at Initial stock inventory,
      * Each time product is received via IN, cost is re-calculated based on
        Moving Average Cost calculation,
      * When Product Cost re-valuation is done.

    These records are only available with an Excel report on the product form.
