  In order to test that no lines with a 0 percentage value could be created, I will create a distribution.
-
  !record {model: analytic.distribution, id: global_distrib_2}:
    name: UF-1681
-
  Then I create a cost center line to 0. This should raise an error
-
  !python {model: cost.center.distribution.line}: |
    from osv import osv
    try:
      self.create(cr, uid, {'currency_id': 1, 'percentage': 0.0, 'name': 'CC Line 3', 'destination_id': ref('analytic_distribution.analytic_account_destination_operation')})
      assert False, "System achieved line creation with a percentage value to 0. It shouldn't!"
    except Exception as e:
      if e.name == 'ValidateError' and e.value == 'Error occurred while validating the field(s) percentage: 0 is not allowed as percentage value!':
        print "System raise the right error. All is OK."
        assert True
      else:
        assert False, "Another problem found."
